Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```

## Summary

For the day planner, the technologies that use fontawesome, moment and bootstrap as a third party styling, html, css and Jquery.  I used local storage to save the data for the time slots

The program has time slots from 9am in the morning until 5pm.  For any hours, the user can add a comment in the block and then press the save icon.  

There are three colours that are in use to define the hour - past hours, current hour and future hours
